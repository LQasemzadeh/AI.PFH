                            Modern technologies and AI are already an integral part of our lives, both in many
                            professional fields and in society. At PFH, we promote and demand an active approach to AI in
                            compliance with the rules and principles of good scientific practice.

                            We see it as our mission to provide students, teaching staff and employees of the university
                            with comprehensive training in the confident use of AI and to sensitise them to compliance
                            with legal and ethical rules. AI can and should be used in teaching, learning and also in the
                            context of academic work, such as Bachelor&apos;s or Master&apos;s theses, term papers and
                            practical reflections. The focus here is on transparent and reflective use, while always
                            keeping an open mindset towards its appliance as well as a critical attitude towards its
                            limitations.

                            We have produced a series of videos in response to the question as to how AI could be used
                            during one&apos;s studies. AI avatars have been used to create these videos. These are
                            artificially generated speakers who present content that has been created and edited by PFH
                            professors.
                            The use of avatars in the videos is an expression of our commitment of actively exploring
                            and utilising the possibilities of AI. Some PFH professors have also agreed to have personal
                            avatars created of themselves. These avatars have been trained by real-life PFH professors
                            and thus represent their <span className="italic">&quot;personal avatars&quot;</span>. To
                            ensure maximum transparency, all videos in which avatars can be seen are labelled &quot;PFH
